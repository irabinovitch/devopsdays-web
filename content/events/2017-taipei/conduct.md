## 反騷擾守則

DevOpsDays 致力於提供每個與會者一個自在的環境，不論性別、性傾向、殘疾、外貌、身材、種族或宗教。我們絕不容忍任何人騷擾與會者，無論任何形式。在會議場地使用帶有性意圖的言語及圖像都是不恰當的行為，包括在議程進行時。與會者若違反規定，大會將視情況予以處置或驅離會場並且不退還費用。

騷擾包含了涉及性別、性傾向、殘疾、外貌、身材、種族、宗教等語帶冒犯的評論；在公共場合展示帶有性意圖的圖像；蓄意恐嚇、跟蹤、尾隨、騷擾攝影與錄影人員；持續干擾議程或其他活動進行；不適當的肢體接觸；不恰當地展露性感。

參展單位、贊助商或廠商在會場或攤位也同樣必須遵守反騷擾守則，特別是參展單位不得使用性意圖的圖像、活動或是其他的方式。攤位工作人員(包含志工)不得使用性意圖的服裝/制服/扮裝，或其他方式來營造性意圖的環境。

如果與會者發生騷擾行為，大會可採取任何適合的行動，包含警告或將騷擾者驅離會場，並且不退還費用。

如果你被騷擾，或是注意到有其他人被騷擾，還是有任何覺得不妥的地方，請立即告知大會工作人員。

你可以透過工作人員識別證找到大會工作人員。工作人員將樂於協助與會者聯絡會場警衛或是法律相關單位，提供護送或其他協助，讓遭受騷擾的人可以在會議期間感到安全。我們重視你的參與。

我們期望與會者在大會場合以及相關社交活動中遵守行為守則。


## 行為守則

I. 我是 Devopsdays 的參與者，透過和其他會眾互相學習、分享，努力提昇自己和所處的產業。與會體驗是由我和其他會眾共同創造。我已經準備好為自己和其他與會者，貢獻我的活力、參與和感受來創造最好的體驗。

II. 我是為了與人互動而來到 Devopsdays。我明白具暗示性或貶抑的圖像、言語會冒犯人而讓人不自在。我同時也明白每個人都有自己的禁忌和敏感之處。在大會活動期間，當被告知某些事冒犯到別人或是讓人無法接受時，我將無條件接受。

III. 我絕對不會故意騷擾或冒犯其他與會者，無論性別、性傾向、殘疾、外貌、身材、種族或宗教，也不會坐視其他參與者被騷擾或冒犯。如果我知道有人感到不自在或不安全，我將會告知那些冒犯的人並通知大會。

IV. 如果我遭受騷擾或冒犯，我會告知身邊讓我有安全感的人以及大會。當我感到安全時，我會根據自己的判斷，告知那些冒犯者具體不當的行為，並希望對方是出於善意和無知的, 但我沒有義務這樣做。

V. 我明白每個人都是不同的，我會視他人行為的真誠程度採取寬恕的態度。不過首要之事是保護我與其他參與者的安全。我將毫不猶服或毫不保留地採舉這樣的行動，直到所有人對於安全都不再有疑慮為止。

VI. 我相信 Devopsdays 大會和與會者將會為所有人共同營造最好的體驗，如同我一樣。我相信 Devopsdays 能讓人更具力量，而我不會忘記我在這裡獲取力量來建立一個安全、成長的環境。如果我或其他與會者違反了這個活動的精神，我期望大會挺身保護與會者，將違反者驅離並連絡相關當局。


## ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY

Devopsdays is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

Conference staff can be identified by distinct staff badges. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to adhere to the code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

I. I am an attendee at devopsdays, learning from and sharing with other devopsdays attendees in an effort to better myself and my industry. I co-create the experience with fellow attendees. I am prepared to give my energy, presence and sensitivity to creating the best possible experience for myself and others.

II. I am coming to devopsdays to interact with people. I understand that imagery and language which is suggestive or derogatory will offend and make people uncomfortable. I also understand that people may have boundaries and sensibilities different from my own. I will accept without question when informed that something is offensive or unacceptable in the context of the devopsdays event.

III. I will never intentionally harass or offend another attendee regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, size, race or religion and will not abide another attendee being harassed or offended. If I am aware that anyone is uncomfortable or unsafe, I will notify those giving offense and the devopsdays event organizers.

IV. If I am offended or harassed, I will inform people around me who make me feel safe and the event organizers. If I feel safe, at my discretion, I will inform those giving offense of the specific actions with the hope that the other party is well-intentioned and ignorant, but I am under no obligation to do so.

V. I understand that people are different and I attempt to be forgiving of others actions at the level of their sincere intent, but my priority is protecting my safety and the safety of others. I will act without hesitation or reservation until there are no question of the safety of all parties.

VI. I trust the devopsdays organizers and attendees will co-create the best possible experience for everyone involved, as I will. I believe devopsdays is about empowering people and I will not forget I am empowered to create a safe and nurturing environment. If I or any other attendee violates this aspect of the event, I expect the conference organizers to protect the attendees by direct action, including expelling those in violation and contacting the proper authorities.
