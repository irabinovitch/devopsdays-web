The conference will take place Thursday July 12 and Friday July 13, 2018 at the <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/minnesota/hilton-minneapolis-MSPMHHH/index.html">downtown Minneapolis Hilton</a>.
<p>
In past years, we worked with the hotel to make space available for nursing mothers, and if that would be useful for you, please let us know. We'd also be happy to accommodate any other accessibility needs upon request:  {{< email_organizers >}}.
<p>
The recommended way to travel between the airport and downtown Minneapolis is via the <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/airport">light rail train</a> to Nicollet Mall station. You can walk (under a mile), transfer to a free bus on Hennepin Ave, walk on the pedestrian Nicollet Mall in downtown, or take a short cab ride from the LRT. Rideshare services are also available.

If you spend most of your time in places like Portland or Brooklyn, our metro will feel familiar, with its bike share stations, beautiful riverfront, and numerous craft brewery tap-rooms with food trucks in their parking lots.
