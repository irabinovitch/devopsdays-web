ChefConf 2016 marked an awakening for me in the DevOps spirit and community. I am a manager in that organization and work hard every day pushing basic DevOps principles and helping to put them in action. I'm also a father of 3 boys who amaze me every day at what they can do. It was Atari Basic and writing Choose Your Adventure games for me and they use Scratch and write puzzle games. I also coach baseball and the Cubmaster for their Pack as well as help with First Lego League.
