It is important for the business team to understand the critical importance of DevOps, the mindset and to prepare for the speed that is acquired when teams adopt this culture. This talk introduces the topics of delivery orchestration, containerization and the DevOps mindset through the business lens to demystify the mindset and present the unique value proposition of organizations that successfully employ this mindset.
