We greatly value sponsors for this open event.  If you are interested in sponsoring, please drop us an email at [{{< email_organizers >}}].

<h2>Why sponsor us?</h2>
Devopsdays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them.  We depend on sponsorship, we are not-for-profit, and the organisers are all working people who are active in the Tech community and passionate about getting DevOps right.  We do not sell product presentations, nor will we distribute attendee contact lists.
<br>
<br>
Devopsdays is a great opportunity to network and build relationships with highly motivated specialists within the DevOps community; share the lessons you've learned; promote your brand and recruitment activities; contribute to important discussions about diversity, burnout, and organisational transformation. All sponsors are encouraged to participate in break-out sessions and generally engage with conference attendees as peers; heavy marketing typically works against you when trying to make a good impression at devopsdays conferences.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Diversity Sponsorship</h3>
A big part of Devopsdays events is interaction; between the speaker sessions, in the open spaces at lunch and during the social events. It is important that a wide variety of voices can be heard and to help with this we are looking to organise <b>diversity sponsorship packages</b>. The money raised from these packages will allow us to make it easier for people from under represented groups to take part.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Social Sponsor</h3>
What could be better than discussing the days events, networking and making new friends at the end of the day? A social sponsor will aid us in providing a space and refreshments dedicated to this purpose, either in the venue itself or further afield.
<br>
<br>
If you are interested in one of the packages below, offering a special sponsorship, or you have creative ideas about how you could support the event in another way then please do drop us an email at {{< email_organizers >}}. We are still working on our diversity and social sponsorship packages but please feel free to contact us if this is something of interest.
