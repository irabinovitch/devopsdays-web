Hi! I’m Carlos. I’m a Technical Principal for Contino. I spend my days helping clients automate, test, deploy and maintain their infrastructure just like they do with their code.

I am passionate about enabling faster, leaner businesses by breaking down silos between development, operations, marketing, sales and business development/operations.

On my off time, I enjoy road biking, working out, writing, visiting new breweries and doing badly at trivia.
