Over the past decade of participating in the production of dozens of apps and growing several engineering teams, I’ve learned a tremendous amount about how not to run a company in a sustainable manner, as well as a few things that work. My experience is very much cross-disciplinary - spanning UX design, front-end development, product management, and operations. I’m currently a Partner at Very and am on a quest to discover how to measure, understand, and help both my company - and those we interact with - establish a generative, sustainable culture.
