Etsy’s blameless post-mortems are a great step to helping teams transition from a culture of blame to a culture of learning. Still, if you are only capturing learnings after bad things happen, teams are missing an opportunity to implement and learn from regular retrospectives or after-action meetings. Learning isn’t only about capturing the problems experienced during a failure, it is about establishing a continual learning culture aimed at continuous improvement. This talk will go over lessons learned from a team that started with blameless post-mortems and migrated to more regular retrospectives.
