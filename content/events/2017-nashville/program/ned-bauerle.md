When planning to utilize either microservices or another service-based architecture it is important to determine the size of the the services and the and frequency of the deployments. It is common for service-based applications to utilize multiple small deployments for services rather than a traditional all-in-one application deployment. It is critical to build a cooperative relationship between the development and operations teams. There are many decisions that need to be made jointly by the development and the operations teams such as how the services will be designed and deployed (i.e. units or isolated responsibilities). In this presentation we will discuss some of the devops decisions that need to be made pertaining to architecture and infrastructure in order to make the project a success.
