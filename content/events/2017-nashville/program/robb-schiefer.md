With DevOps being a relatively new “movement”, there are few stories of real world .NET development groups in enterprise-size companies successfully adopting Continuous Delivery and DevOps practices. Many .NET teams are discouraged by the lack of support for Windows/.NET or the daunting task of learning a completely new set of tools/languages. They are looking for guidance from those who have been through the trenches and have real world experience.

Our teams have successfully made this transition for 100s of components in 60+ internal business products and routinely have products deploy multiple times per week. We have seen a ton of value from implementing DevOps (even early on) but we aren’t done yet. It’s a journey of continuous improvement.

In this talk, you will learn about the major principles of DevOps and the journey of small incremental steps our teams took to get where we are today.  This includes both our successes and failures.  You will leave this talk with new knowledge of tools, processes and examples from a real development group that you can take back to your team(s) to successfully implement DevOps.
