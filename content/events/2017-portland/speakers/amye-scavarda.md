Implementer of sanity in fast-paced chaos. Pleasant, cheerful and competent in a sea of snark. I'm at Red Hat as their Gluster Community Lead. I help feed and water the Gluster.org community. Previously, I was a Drupal and DevOps project manager, expanding out the world one little website + infrastructure build at a time.
