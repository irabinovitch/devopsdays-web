 As a container is tested and promoted through lifecycle environments, it is likely rebuilt at each stage along the way. This talk highlights what can cause a container to mutate from one build to another and makes a strong argument for promoting binaries as you need to move code through all the lifecycle environments in your CI pipeline. Attendees will examine the difficulties of using a standalone Docker registry to promote builds from one environment to another and will then see a demo of how to use Pulp and Crane to enhance this experience. This talk would be appreciated by both developers maintaining CI pipelines as well as release engineers deploying applications to production.
