[Mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/) is a next gen config management engine that takes a fresh look at existing automation problems.
The tool has two main parts: the engine, and the language.
This presentation will briefly discuss and demo a prototype of the language.
We'll also explain how the language is implemented in terms of the graph API, and how alternate inputs can be used.
We'll even show you how you can write pure golang code to libify mgmt.
Finally we'll talk about some of the future designs we're planning and make it easy for new users to get involved and help shape the project.
