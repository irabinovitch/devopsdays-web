We will demonstrate how a mongoDB multi-instance solution can be deployed on kubernernese cluster running on Diamanti D10 appliance within minutes. This solution will be fully resilient, scalable, highly available and quickly recoverable. We will demonstrate how we can easily set up networks and volumes on a kubernetes cluster running on Diamanti appliance. Also we will demonstrate how Diamanti mirroring solution can speedup the recovery process in case of failure to make sure not just its highly available also its running full capacity at all time. This will be a live demo combined with powerpoint presentation.
