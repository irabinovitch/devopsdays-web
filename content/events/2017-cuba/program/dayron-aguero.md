The investment in technological infrastructure represents a vital asset of 
the company for the continuity of the business. Keeping applications and 
services available 24x7 represents a challenge because of the complexity 
and growth of them. Complex IT environments, third-party applications, 
and parallel application development create an environment that is 
difficult to monitor. The use of metrics to monitor development infrastructure 
seems to be a good bet to help organizations improve the application programming, 
cost estimation, software quality, and risk mitigation as they grow or change 
infrastructure.
