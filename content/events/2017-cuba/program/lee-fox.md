Back in at the 2001 OOPSLA Conference, the term Software Archeology was first coined. 
It gave a set of tools and processes for understanding a poorly documented and 
poorly maintained software architecture. It didnâ€™t just work for the undocumented 
codebases, but ones that are incredibly large and complex, even if good documentation 
exists. The idea was to follow the true archeology with investigative work to understand 
the mindsets of the people who did the original implementations. Nowadays, the 
problem of understanding software still exists, but has also grown by a quite 
with the larger scales of production environments that are often times distributed 
or found in the cloud. So, this session will help the DevOps engineer walking into 
a new shop with tools and techniques to understand, not only the code, but the 
entire production system as well. This will help provide faster ramp time, higher 
quality software implementations, and more stable production environments.
