Randy is a 25-year veteran of Silicon Valley, and has worked as a senior technology 
leader and executive at companies ranging from small startups, to mid-sized places, to 
eBay and Google. Randy is currently VP Engineering at Stitch Fix in San Francisco. 

Earlier, Randy was Chief Engineer at eBay for 6 1/2 years, where he was responsible for 
multiple generations of eBay's realtime search infrastructure.  He was CTO and co-founder 
of a startup, and learned just how difficult and different it is to build a company from 
scratch. He was Director of Engineering at Google for Google App Engine, building and 
operating the world's largest platform-as-a-service. He also spent a year and a half 
applying eBay and Google lessons consulting with startups and large enterprises on how 
to improve their organizations and technology. 

Randy has been speaking about scalability, architecture, and engineering culture 
since 2006. He is a co-organizer of the QCon family of conferences, and is 
particularly passionate about the nexus of culture, technology, and organization.
