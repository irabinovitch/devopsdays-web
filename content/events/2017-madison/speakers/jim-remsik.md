A world-renowned hugger, community instigator, and speaker who genuinely desires success in those around him and does what he can to make that happen. Jim has spent his career building teams which led to the founding of Adorable. He is a connector of people and problem-solver with a varied background that includes roles such as: Short-order Cook, Printing Apprentice, Wedding Photographer, and Backwards Stock Car Driver.He makes mistakes, especially, on stage. This should be fun.
