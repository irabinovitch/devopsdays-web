Shel Silverstein said "Never explain what you do. It speaks for itself. You only muddle it by talking about it." I like to think my work mostly says "200 OK."

For the past 20 years I have been responsible for information security for various service providers. Most of the time I blended this practice with other duties like programming, system administration, technical support, and cloud operations. My current role is compliance officer for a private healthcare software company.
