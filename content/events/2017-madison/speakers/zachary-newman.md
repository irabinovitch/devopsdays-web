Iâ€™m a social psychologist masquerading as a Web Operations Software Engineer at SportsEngine. I have a degree in Psychology and Reconciliation, which in the Software Engineer/ Operations field provides me with unique perspective on hows and whys of the ways that things happen in our industry. I seek to be a culture hacker and to see how I can make the world around me a better place.
