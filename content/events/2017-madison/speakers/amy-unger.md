The granddaughter of a former MIT computer (yup, that was a job title), Amy was clearly supposed to be a programmer, but just did not get the message. Her wanderings have taken her through the land of libraries and archives and into software consulting. Now a software engineer at Heroku, she is deeply grateful for every scarce day she does not use vim commands in Google Docs.
