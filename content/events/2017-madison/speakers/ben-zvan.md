Ben Zvan is a Minneapolis IT professional who has concentrated on the mantra “simplify, standardize, automate” since hearing the phrase from Jim Hall at the U of MN, and realized that’s what he had been doing for years. Learning about agile and DevOps made him an instant evangelist. He currently works with containers, change automation, production support, and not having enough time for photography or motorcycling.
