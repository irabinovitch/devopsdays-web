<p>
DevOpsDays Phoenix 2017 is currently accepting session, tutorial, and lightning talk proposals from interested speakers. This is your chance to be a more active part in the conference and place your mark on the local DevOps community.
<p>

We encourage submission of a wide range of original material relevant for people working in or with Technology organizations, especially by new presenters and people with underrepresented perspectives or roles.
<p>
<h3>Submit your talk!</h3>
Go to our <a href="https://www.papercall.io/devopsdays-phoenix-2017"><strong><em>PaperCall.io CFP page</strong></em></a> for more information and to submit!

<h3>Talk Types:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Topic or Panel Session:</strong></em>30 minute slots to share your perspective on a topic and answer questions from the community. Code snippets, architectural diagrams, and live demos are great presentation tactics for these talks.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Tutorial or Workshop Session:</strong></em> 30 minute slots to work through a problem with a group. These are usually targeted at more beginner levels, helping people get comfortable with a new technology, and understanding how they might apply it in their own organization.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Ignite talk:</strong></em> 5 minutes slots with 20 slides changing every 15 seconds that will be presented during the Ignite sessions in the main room</li>
</ol>

<h3>The main selection criteria are:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>Original content:</strong></em> content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem</li>
  <li><strong><em>New presenters:</strong></em> people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybodyâ€™s voice</li>
  <li><strong><em>No vendor pitches:</strong></em> as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we do not think Topic and Ignite talks are the right forum. You may demo at your table or during Open Space.</li>
</ol>
We also welcome community-driven discussion and interaction by proposing and facilitating an Open Space session.
