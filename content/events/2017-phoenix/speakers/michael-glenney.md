I am a Solutions Architect for New Context Services, a San Francisco based Lean Security, Devops, and Automation consulting firm. I am based in Mesa, Arizona. Locally I have worked as a Sr. DevOps Engineer for both Apollo Group and Lifelock. I wouldn't know a One Direction member from a Two Directions member but I'm sure they're great people. I have 4 kids. I grew up in Ahwatukee. In my spare time I hang with the kids, like to travel, and listen to classic rock, metal, and old-skool rap.
