Secrets are pervasive in modern systems and managing them across an organization is a complex task. How you store your passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information is just the beginning. Those secrets have a complex life-cycle of access, creation, revocation, and audit history that needs to be controlled. HashiCorp Vault is an open source tool that aims to address those issues. It provides a unified interface to secrets in your organization along with access control and audit logs.
