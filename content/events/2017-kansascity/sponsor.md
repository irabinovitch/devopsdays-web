<hr>

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships. We do not sell product presentations. Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during, and after the event.<br><br>Sponsors are
encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and
engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the
opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space
session, but this is not 'that kind of conference' and heavy
marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
<br><br>
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms. Sponsors are responsible for providing high-res logos for use on the website and in promotional materials.  The preferred file formats are EPS or AI.
