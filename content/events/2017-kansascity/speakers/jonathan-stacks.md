I like to automate things to make my life easier: CLI tools, Repository Builds, CI/CD pipelines. Love good tests and code coverage. Love to learn new things and share what I learn with others.

Favorite Languages

Python. For my general automation needs.
Ruby. When I want to throw up a website fast and write pretty code. Great community and documentation.
Golang. If you need a TCP server, concurrency, or efficient execution, give it a try!
Other Favorites

Docker. But, no really, it changed my life as both a developer and deployer.
Travis CI. Open source your project and enjoy the GitHub PR integration.
