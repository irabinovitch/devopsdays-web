Dad, husband, aspiring world traveler, and avid reader (for fun and not knowledge). Todd Brees spent many years out with the unwashed masses managing consumer electronics stores. After obtaining a Masters of Computer Science at the University of Missouri in Kansas City, he now spends his days in front of a computer alternating between feeling like the king of the world and a dog staring at a screen.
