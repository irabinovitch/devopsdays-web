I am a 27 year old Senior DevOps Engineer at New Context Services. I have experience in AWS, Rails, Chef, TF, CI/CD shenanigans and other buzzwords like Full-Stack, Agile, the cloud etc. I’ve seen people operate so beautifully I could cry, and I’ve seen … well, I’ve seen the other side too.

I like doing things the right way and for the right reasons. I’m one of those 0 or 100 kind of people, I’m either all in or not in at all.

I play the support hero in LoL / Dota. I like reading epic fantasy like Robert Jordan, Patrick Rothfuss and Stephen King and playing table top games like MtG and Catan etc. I like sports and happen to run a fantasy football league for some friends. I prefer Stouts and red wine over anything else, but if you’re buying I’m in.
