In DevOps it is common to have Ruby, Python and Bash on all Windows machines - will you install PowerShell on your Mac workstation and Linux servers?

What if PowerShell's platform of origin had not been Windows or if it had not started as a proprietary product?  Would you view it differently today?

This talk is about how the architecture of PowerShell puts developer productivity front and center and how that has a direct, practical, positive effect on the individual developer experience as well as team level benefits.

This intentional design aspect of PowerShell causes it to generate real business ROI as well as individual developer productivity.

This is my second time around with a hyper-productive shell environment as it was OS/400 that some of PowerShell's key concepts were pulled from.

As background, I maintain a PowerShell universal installer for the Microsoft port of OpenSSH as well as a Bash universal installer for installing PowerShell Core on Linux and OSX.  I have also written a multi-platform PowerShell script to make an AWS account compliant with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.

If you don't enjoy being productive, this session is not for you.
