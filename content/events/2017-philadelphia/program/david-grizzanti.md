Are the benefits of containerization limited to ease of integration, testing, deployment and operations? David Grizzanti explains how his team at Comcast -- which develops a highly performant, distributed software system supporting millions of customers and deployed across multiple data centers -- moved large-scale, multi-data-center services from an architecture deployed on virtual machines supported by separate development and operations teams to one based on containers with Apache Mesos operated by a single DevOps team, sharing how Comcast overcame multiple challenges -- some that were anticipated and many that were not.

David discusses the team’s journey from excited experimentation through the valleys of frustration and ultimately to a deeper appreciation for containerization and explains how they were able to get everything working; and optimize the architecture to support service discovery and multitenancy in some interesting ways. 

Topics include:
- Some of the basics: Environments, tools, choices
- War games and surprises: IP addresses, logging, metrics
- Team organization: Taking responsibility for development, integration, and operations of the platform
- Application errors under load
- Debugging performance
- Scaling the application up
- Supporting multi-tenancy
- Simplifying the application’s core algorithm
- Achieving superior performance
