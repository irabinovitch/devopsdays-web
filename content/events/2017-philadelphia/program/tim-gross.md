Software architecture. Software engineering. Software construction. Practitioners of the architecture, engineering, and construction of buildings might consider these terms to be overly lofty for the craft of software development. One of these industries is plagued by cost overruns, failed projects, religious battles over methodologies, dysfunctional teams, and unhappy clients, but is also innovative, socially conscious, and applying technology to solve real-world problems. And the other is software development.

Tim Gross worked for a decade in the building industry before switching to building software. In this talk Tim will explore how designing and constructing buildings is nothing like your software project -- except in all the ways that they both succeed and fail.
