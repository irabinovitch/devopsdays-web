Data is an integral part of every application, so why aren’t we talking about it more when it comes to DevOps and including the DBAs in this important conversation. In this session, we'll talk about why the database has been left behind and the special challenges it presents.  We'll also explore the similarities to application development and show that even though there are challenges, it is possible to include your database in DevOps processes. It’s time to start thinking about incorporating your databases into your best practices so it's no longer the bottleneck.
