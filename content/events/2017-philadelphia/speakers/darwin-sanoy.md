Darwin Sanoy is a Senior Cloud Architect at Infor where he builds shared tooling for automating platform provisioning and Continuous Delivery.  He has pivoted his career from Traditional Enterprise IT to Agile, DevOps and Cloud (with a good dose of "security built-in").

Darwin's background differs from many DevOps pros in that he started into DevOps as a deep Windows IT Pro (versus the deep Linux development background that is very common).  Darwin has been loving doing Windows automation for over 20 years - which means doing CLI automation before the Mangement-by-GUI era of Windows.

Darwin is a PluralSight course author, open source Chocolatey packager, CIS AWS Benchmark contributor (multiplatform PowerShell code) and was awarded the "PowerShell Open Source Projects Top Contributor for 2017" designation for building a universal installer for the Windows port of OpenSSH.  Darwin also built the Universal PowerShell Core bash installer (Install-PowerShell.sh) for installing PowerShell Core and Visual Studio Code on any supported Linux distro and OSX.
