<p>Systems Engineer at Cisco Systems<p>

<p>Owen spends his time testing the notion that Infrastructure-as-Code might just make everyone's life better. A Network Architect in a previous life, these days he devotes less time to configuring routers than building cloud environments with Terraform, Ansible, Packer, Python etc. When not in front of a screen or hunting for missing toys, he runs a bit.<p>
