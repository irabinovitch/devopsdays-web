<p>A senior software engineer with 12 years experience in IT.  I started my career with Duolog Technologies working in hardware but steadily moved towards software.  My hardware background has proven advantageous in giving my software a deep grounding in computer architecture.  I currently design and develop Java Web and mobility applications for DXC.  I have a strong interest in the application of DevOps to drive collaboration, consistency and continuous improvement in software delivery.<p>
