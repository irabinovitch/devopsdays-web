<p>What's all the fuss with serverless architecture? To some, it is the future of architecture implementation and is disrupting DevOps, traditional implementation models, enterprise approaches to IT, and entry to and time to market.</p>

<p>This talk is an experience report on how our team fell into a serverless implementation without any real experience of the technology and how we learned about it along the way. I will give a brief overview of what serverless is and its benefits and how we went from sceptics of it initially to advocates along our journey of discovery.</p>

<p>I will describe our team test first mentality and the multiple functional and non-functional approaches and patterns we applied to serverless, as well as the existing challenges of testing it. That includes how we ran exploratory performance tests to determine and quantify language deficiencies on the platform in order to help drive our implementation approach.</p>
