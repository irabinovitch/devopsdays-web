<p>In January 2016 Activision approved a pilot project to build a containerised continuous delivery pipeline using Docker.  This project spanned multiple devops teams and would culminate in launching a production title "Skylanders Imaginators" in October 2016.<p>

<p>This talk will discuss the cultural and technical challenges faced throughout the pilot. Spoiler alert: Not everyone was happy with the decision to use Docker.  The talk will cover the concerns and how we handled them.<p>

<p>For the first time in Demonware history developers were responsible for the launch and support of a title.  This included infrastructure provisioning, load testing and on call duties.<p>
