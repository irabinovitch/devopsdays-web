<p>Hybrid Cloud is awesome, but running applications across multiple clouds can be difficult. Features like Cloud bursting, high availability, federation etc. require highly skilled technical experts to deploy and manage - wouldn't it be great if there was a tool that could help? Fear no more, Kubernetes Federation is what you've been looking for.</p>

<p>Kubernetes Federation makes it easy to manage and synchronise multiple clusters, enabling businesses to efficiently and cost-effectively deploy and manage applications across cloud providers and physical data centers.</p>

<p>In this session we will show how to setup Kubernetes Federation to interconnect Kubernetes clusters running in different clouds and  also demonstrate how to use Federation for the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run the backend and frontend of an application in different clouds whilst managing them from a single control plane</li>
  <li>Improve fault tolerance by distributing an application across two clouds</li>
  <li>Scale your application to deal with increased load by using resources from a different clouds (cloudburst)</li>
  <li>Schedule workload to an specific cloud, based on cloud provider conditions such as price, performance, capabilities</li>
</ul>
