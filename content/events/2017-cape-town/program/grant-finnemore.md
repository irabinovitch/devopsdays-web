##### WORKSHOP ABSTRACT

Atlassian’s and Bamboo’s continuous integration capabilities can be combined with Jira Service Desk, Jira, Bitbucket, to give you a unified view of your software development project. Integrating Bamboo with JIRA and Stash provides traceability and visibility across teams. It allows each team member to stay with the tool of their choice and keeps the entire product team on top of each issue's implementation, quality, and release status.
