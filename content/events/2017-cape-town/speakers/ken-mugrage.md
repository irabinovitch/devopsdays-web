Ken Mugrage is a Technology Evangelist for ThoughtWorks, which is just a fancy way to say his job is to make people better at Continuous Delivery and DevOps.

He began his IT career in the early 1990s as a system administrator for Seattle’s first Internet service provider. Ken went on to form his own web development company in 1994, creating some of the first data-driven websites anywhere. During the next twenty years he held almost every position in a software development organization—from developer to director of a global engineering team. Using his experience Ken has consulted with top companies on applying the right technical solutions to business problems.
