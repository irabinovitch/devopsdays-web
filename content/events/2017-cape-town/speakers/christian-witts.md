Christian Witts is a chronic sufferer of imposter syndrome, and a starter of far to many empty repositories. Herder of rats, poster of things, and alleged polyglot, you'll find him trying to automate things such that they do not break so that he can get back to his coffee. He has been programming since '89, and getting paid for it since '05, working in credit bureaux, energy management, eCommerce, and most recently adTech. You'll find him in his off time writing renderers in whatever language tickles his fancy that week, and consuming to many podcasts and audio books.
