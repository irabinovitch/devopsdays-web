I’ve gone from being a seasoned connoisseur of the reboot inside a NOC to designing and building my own DC for 10,000 Servers. I’ve formed some seriously unhealthy work habits and managed to fix them. There was a time where I was nominated on call for 4 months without a single break. I have spent 8 of the last 10 years with contractual on call responsibility.
