Andrea Giardini has been fascinated by the DevOps mindset since the early
days of this movement. He has been working extensively with configuration
management and cloud computing, gaining experience with different platforms.
After working at CERN, where he wrote his master thesis about configuration
management, he moved to Berlin where he is currently employed at Camunda as a
DevOps engineer. Here he takes care of the infrastructure that hosts Cawemo, the
new product by Camunda to write BPMN diagrams online collaboratively.
