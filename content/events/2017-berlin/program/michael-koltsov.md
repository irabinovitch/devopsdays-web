Serverless is a big trend now, as a new way to go beyond your own infrastructure relying on someone's PaaS instead. Most of the solutions people usually know are proprietary FaaS solutions provided by the major cloud providers.
 
But what would you do if you'd like to experiment, having your own servers or even data centers without exposing your customers' data in the cloud?
 
You can experiment with FaaS solutions built upon either Apache Mesos or Kubernetes. But, I would like to show a practical case of migrating an existing enterprise software to the Apache OpenWhisk platform by showing what to expect when you've decided to go ""serverless"" for real.
