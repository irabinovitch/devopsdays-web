Prerequisites
 
Participants should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop. Participants will be given a remote workstation with all prerequisites installed. The only thing required to access these workstations will be an SSH client (PuTTY on Windows) and familiarity with a interactive text editor (Vi/Vim, Emacs, or Nano).
 
It’s best that participants of this workshop have some familiarity and comfort with the following:
 
Writing code (of just about any flavor) in a text editor
Working on the command line
Basic system administration – installing packages, configuring those packages, starting service
