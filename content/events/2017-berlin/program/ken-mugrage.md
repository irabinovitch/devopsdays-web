Automated processes that don’t actually reach production are called continuous delivery when they’re actually more like improved continuous integration. This talk explores code management strategies, deployment patterns, and cd pipelines you can use to make sure you can deploy right now.
 
People often say that they’re practicing continuous delivery, and then add something like “I can let the security team know any time” or “I just have to run the performance tests.” Ken Mugrage explains why you’re not done with your continuous delivery journey if you can’t push your software to production right now. Some of the things covered in this talk: Why I think trunk based development is key to Continuous Delivery Using feature toggles and branch by abstraction to enable true Continuous Integration Deployment methodologies which are well known terms (Canary, Dark Launching) but often not well implemented Things that should be part of the CD Pipeline such as security and performance tests This is an opinionated, fast moving, high level talk. The goal of this talk is to make people think about the practices they could be doing to make their transition to DevOps and Continuous Delivery more effective.
