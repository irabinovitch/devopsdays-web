Workshops are a great way of developing skills and sharing knowledge within
your organisation, and they also encourage a culture of learning together.
But running a workshop by yourself can seem daunting, especially if you
aren’t an expert in the area you want your organisation to get better at.

I’ll talk about my experience of running a web security workshop at the UK’s
Government Digital Service, what we did to improve our culture of learning
and how you can do something similar where you work.

The talk covers:
- the impact that running workshops can have on your culture
- my personal journey towards being happy to run one despite not being a
  security expert myself
- tricks you can use to help you take on new challenges
- practical tips for running a workshop
- what I learned by doing this
- how I made it easier for people to run other workshops, making it a
  sustainable part of our culture of learning
