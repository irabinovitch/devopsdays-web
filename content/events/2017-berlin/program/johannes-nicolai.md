Having short, reproducible build steps are a must have for any continuous delivery pipeline -
declarative dependency management with pom files, NPM, bower, yarn, composer etc. has been the standard for many years in most web centered scenarios.
The idea to always compile all dependencies from scratch and check the binaries into version control are commonly perceived as a DevOps anti-pattern.
However, in the embedded C and C++ world, declarative dependency management is still relatively new and one big roadblock to fast, reproducible and secure releases.

This hands-on session will show
* why package management is a good thing (TM)
* why Git submodules are no silver bullet
* how conan.io, an Open Source, platform independent package manager can be used for managing dependencies C/C++ libraries
* how one can build a funny application based libcurl and libgit2 on many platforms within minutes
* that there finally is no excuse for C/C++ developers to join the hipsters on the DevOps trainHaving short, reproducible build steps are a must have for any continuous delivery pipeline -
