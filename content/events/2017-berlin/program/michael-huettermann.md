In this interactive, demo-driven session, weâ€™ll set up a holistic Continuous
Delivery pipeline with the use of DevOps enabler tools, based on Cloud,
microservices and container technologies. While setting up the pipeline, we go
through a set of recipes for both concepts and tools to underpin DevOps.
Toolchains show exemplary how to implement the concepts. Recipes for the
following are included:

- how to derive holistic pipelines
- how to utilize best-of-breed tools while minimizing vendor lock-in
- how to visualize and design pipelines, with Jenkins Blue Ocean
- how to build and stage/promote binaries (e.g. with Java EE WAR, Docker images)
- how to inject quality gates and increase cycle time
- how to handle snapshots and releases, with Maven
- how to use Jenkins 2 scripted and declarative pipelines
- how to extend the tools, e.g. Jenkins, with Shared Libraries and Groovy
- how to inspect source code and binaries
- how to visualize layers of Docker images
- how to use standards, such as REST API, to rollout scripted solutions
- how to set up functional monitoring, with ELK
- how to utilize cloud, container and microservice technologies
