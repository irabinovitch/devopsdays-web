As in a good Greek Tragedy, scaling devops to big teams has 3 stages and usually end badly. In this play (it’s more than a talk!) we’ll present you with Pentagon Inc, and their way to scaling devops from a team of 3 engineers to a team of 100 (spoiler – it’s painful!)
In this talk we’ll take you to a scaling journey, from 3 developers to a 100. We’ll talk about the challenges each milestone in this growth brings, both technological and methodological, and how to solve  those challenges using the right mix of people, the right selection of tools and the correctly crafted process. The speakers excel in the different aspects of this triangle and went through this journey (more than once) themselves. And the fun and entertaining presentation as a Greek tragedy can’t hurt, can it? As in a good Greek Tragedy, scaling devops to big teams has 3 stages and usually end badly.
