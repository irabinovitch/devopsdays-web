Jack Danger is a serial entrepreneur who led engineering teams at Square and is now building Opsolutely (the deployments platform you'd eventually build in-house if you had the time). He's a prolific open source contributor and he loves to help people realize how accessible and simple many so-called "hard" technologies are. He's a maintainer of the Moto project, the in-memory clone of all of AWS, and hopes you'll join him in contributing to this fun and useful tool.
