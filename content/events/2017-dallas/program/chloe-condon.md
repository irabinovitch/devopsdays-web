##### TALK ABSTRACT

Old staging methodology is broken for modern development. In fact, the staging server is left over from when we built monolithic applications. Find out why microservice architectures are driving ephemeral testing environments & why every sized dev shop should deliver true continuous deployment.

Staging servers slow down development with merge conflicts, slow iteration loops, and manhour intensive processes. To build better software faster containers and infrastructure as code are key in 2017. Dev Ops professionals miss this talk at their own peril.
