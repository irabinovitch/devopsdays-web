##### WORKSHOP ABSTRACT

InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security, and other policy requirements. Easily integrate automated tests that check for adherence to policy into any stage of your deployment pipeline.

This is a hands-on workshop that will give participants an introduction to InSpec and the ideas and practices required to achieve continuous compliance.  During this session, participants will:

* Run InSpec locally on a machine
* Run InSpec on a remote machine
* Use InSpec in the Chef cookbook development process for integration testing

##### Prerequisites

Attendees should bring a wifi-enabled laptop to the workshop.

Attendees will be given a remote workstation with all prerequisites installed. The only thing required to access these workstations will be an SSH client ([PuTTY on Windows](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)) and familiarity with a interactive text editor ([Vi/Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html), or [Nano](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/nano/)).

It’s best that students of this class have some familiarity and comfort with the following:

* Writing code (of just about any flavor) in a text editor
* Working on the command line
* Basic system administration – installing packages, configuring those packages, starting service
