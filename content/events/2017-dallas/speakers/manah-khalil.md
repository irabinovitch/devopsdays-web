Manah has over 20 years of software engineering in various roles including architecture, design, testing, and security. That helped me look at application security and its impact, seen from the various stakeholders of application systems: IT, Management, Legal, Business Partners, Security and others. The cost of Security on IT is significant, taking away expensive capacity from the business. In my experience the solution was to prioritize the spending on security related initiative equally between tools and technical debt, and ways to change and measure the organizational culture. In the last two years at Verizon I spent my time and effort on standing up the IT Application Security team, and building self-service tools and processes to promote the security “shift-left” culture. As part of this initiative I had to measure and quantify the result of that work and ended up designing a dashboard that can help in identifying the effect of that work on indicators of culture change.

Proven track record of 20+ years of experience in software development and IT operations with Fortune 100 companies. Driving the implementation of the IT Application Security Strategy across various business units, the rollout of DevSecOps and the IT Security Awareness Program. Directly contributed to increasing the Close Rate on new sales of the Verizon FiOS TV service by 8% between 2010 and 2011. Implemented the Verizon National Call Routing strategy in 2013, enabling over $21M in annual cost savings. Two-time Verizon Credo Award recipient for work related to improving sales and efficiency in call centers. A Microsoft Gold Star Award recipient for work associated with the Microsoft BizTalk Server. Always looking to leverage my strategic insight and technical expertise in IT, Application Security, mobility, e-commerce, and telecom to support and drive shareholders’ value.
