Software development is a social activity that favours direct human contact, yet 21st century life can often get in the way, forcing us to reconsider our communication patterns. Whether you are building a collocated, remote, or distributed team, there is one component in software development that remains unchanged: the human element. 

Using the experiences of two team leaders from startup and enterprise contexts, this presentation will guide you to building happier, more resilient teams regardless of where its humans are located.
