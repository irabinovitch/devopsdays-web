Most companies today develop apps and deploy them on servers — whether on-premises or in the cloud. That involves deploying and managing all the underlying infrastructure for your app. What if you could just write the app code and not have to worry about the infrastructure and how it will scale? Amazon Web Services sparked a movement known as serverless or functions as a service (FaaS) with their launch of Lambda in 2014. Lambda lets developers focus on building applications without worrying about the heavy lifting of all the behind the scenes stuff. Serverless architectures have been steadily growing in popularity with new frameworks (Ok, not as many as JavaScript) and tools being created to help facilitate FaaS.

In this talk, we’ll review Lambda internals so you can understand what AWS is doing behind the scenes. We’ll cover the various ways you can trigger Lambda functions and go through example use cases. Finally, we’ll cover some of the gotchas that only come from actually running Lambda in production!
