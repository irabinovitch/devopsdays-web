Jason is a technical writer & evangelist at Datadog, where he works to inspire engineers with the power of data, metrics and monitoring. He’s also involved in the global DevOpsDays community and was formerly the DevOps & performance community manager at O’Reilly Media. When he’s not writing code or documentation, you can often find him travel-hacking on a plane or pursuing his love of fire and knives in a restaurant kitchen.
