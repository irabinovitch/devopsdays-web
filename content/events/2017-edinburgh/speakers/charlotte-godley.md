Charlotte Godley is a Platform Automation Engineer working on the Kubernetes platform at Ocado Technology. Previously she has worked as a developer in industries lacking great processes and deployment strategies. Drawing on her experiences, in her current role she relishes the opportunity to destroy development roadblocks whilst writing services for ops teams to monitor the platform's response. As a developer in her own time, she writes a blog on side projects and quirks of different technologies. She writes to elucidate her thought process in an approachable manner. Her aim is to make it easier for the next person with the same problem, and as a result her blog posts have been helpful to beginners and experienced programmers alike.
