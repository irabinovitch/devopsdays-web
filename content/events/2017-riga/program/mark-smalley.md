<h3>Workshop</h3>

<p><em>DevOps is a growing movement for shortening development and deployment and integrating Development and Operations. This requires a mindset shift, new behaviours and a cultural shift in both Development and Operations.</em></p>

<p>Business are demanding ever shorter release cycles for new applications. ‘Operations’ is traditionally seen as a barrier with lengthy bureaucratic controls and delays in deploying new releases to production. DevOps is a growing movement for shortening development and deployment and integrating Development and Operations. This requires a mindset shift, new behaviours and a cultural shift in both Development and Operations. Traditionally suspicious of each other, they must now work closely together. Yet many companies are struggling to adopt and deploy DevOps and how to change the culture.
The Phoenix Project game has been designed to address this cultural and behavioural change, letting you experience good and bad communication and collaboration, and encouraging you to experiment, learn and improve. It is normally played during a full day and with participants from one organisation, and in this half-day ‘taster’ workshop, played with people from different organisations, you’ll not only have the opportunity to assess the value of business simulations and experiential learning, but you’ll also make some practical discoveries that you can apply when you get back to work.</p>
