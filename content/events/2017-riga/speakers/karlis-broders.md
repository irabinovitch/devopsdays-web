<h3>IT consultant, Project Manager at AA Projekts</h3>

<p>After graduating with a degree in natural sciences of mathematics during his first interview at an IT company all Kārlis could say is: “I can fast, wait and think.” (akin to a certain character from a novel by Hermann Hesse). Either way, Kārlis ended up with having everyday work concerned with management, development, maintenance and auditing of enterprise information systems. Seeing the not-so-encouraging failure/success rate of many development and implementation projects, one starts looking for better ways, innovation and opportunities for improvement. 

<p>He is keen to learn, read, listen and share (and apply) ideas and knowledge in many areas such as iterative design and architecture in Agile dev projects, continuous integration/delivery/deployment practices, ops work automation and more.</p>

<p>As IT consultant in AA Projekts he is doing IT consulting, business and system requirements analysis and development, leading IS testing teams, application lifecycle management (ALM), implementation and adaption of ALM tools to improve clients' abilities to govern and manage their IT resources.
Kārlis is also playing golf to a reasonably high level (he has represented the Latvian national team on the international stage on many occasions) and he is infatuated by the study of golf swing technique and the whole high-tech gear and gadget industry around it.</p>
