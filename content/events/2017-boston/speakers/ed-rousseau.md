I am a 20 year veteran of the software industry who has mainly worked in the QA space with occasional detours leading infrastructure tools teams both in startups and the enterprise. I am passionate about quality and software engineering efficiency and an unabashed Kanban fanboy. I am also a philosopher, lover of fine food and cocktails, occasional DJ and master of the rhetorically awkward question.
