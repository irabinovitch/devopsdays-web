Yulan is a Data Scientist living and working in Houston, TX. Her work ranges from natural language processing to data visualization, and her experiences range from conference operations to bioinformatics. She originally fell in love with code because of Linux and RNA-sequencing, and has traded beakers and pipets for Jupyter notebooks and split terminal windows. When not writing code, she can be found on Twitter, fangirling over Lin-Manuel-Miranda, or having ridiculous intellectual conversations over coffee.
