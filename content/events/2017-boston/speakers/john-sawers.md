I’m the co-founder and CTO of Data Simply; I’ve been programming professionally for two decades. In recent years I have also been supervising emotional release workshops called “Purpose, Passion, Peace”, based on the work of Alfred Adler. These workshops were designed to create a safe space for people to finally face feelings they’ve been avoiding for most of their lives.
