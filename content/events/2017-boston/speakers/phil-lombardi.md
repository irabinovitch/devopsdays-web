Phil is a Senior Platform Engineer at Datawire.io where he is building a development platform aimed at small companies adopting or using microservices and Kubernetes with a need for their platform to be simple, resilient and adaptable to the ever-changing tech landscape. When not pounding on his keyboard or wrangling cloud infrastructure Phil is often found hitting the links to play golf or wandering around the city of Boston looking for the next exciting thing to do.
