Companies adopting microservices are recognizing the importance of the service mesh: a transparent layer that adds application-level resilience, observability, and security to your infrastructure. In this talk, we’ll talk about what a service mesh, why you might need it, and how it works. We’ll show a service mesh in action, using the open source Envoy, Istio, and Ambassador projects running on Kubernetes.
