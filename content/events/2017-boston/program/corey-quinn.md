AWS Lambda ushers in a new way of thinking about solving technical problems. Unfortunately, when the only tool you have is a hammer everything starts to look like your thumb. In this talk, come explore the design patterns that work well with Lambda, through a discussion of what failure looks like.

This talk starts off with a quick introduction to what AWS Lambda is and where it came from. From there, we transition into demonstrating the absolutely worst possible ways in which to use itâ€“ along with what make these simple mistakes terrible ideas at scale. You will laugh, you will cry, you will immediately begin migrating your code away from anywhere the speaker might conceivably have access to it.
