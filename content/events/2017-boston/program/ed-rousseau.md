How does the QA role fit into a world of DevOps and Continuous Delivery? Is it still even relevant? This session will examine these question and propose ways in which a QA mindset contributes to a successful DevOps and Continuous Delivery practice.

Topics will include: 
* A short history of software quality assurance: Waterfall - Agile - DevOps 
* Definitions: What is QA anyway and what it isn’t. Who are we? 
* Why QA and Ops traditionally have a complimentary mindset 
* Why a QA mindset is still relevant in a “Full-stack” “NoOps” world 
* What the quality implications are of “Infrastructure as Code” 
* What changes about QA in a DevOps world? What skills are needed and what opportunities exist for QA minded individuals 
* Q&A about QA in a DevOps environment
