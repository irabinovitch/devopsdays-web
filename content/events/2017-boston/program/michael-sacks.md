As technology becomes a bigger part of our lives, so does our power to affect peopleâ€™s lives: not always for the better.

Technology can be a life saver, (i.e. the Maps app), but there has been an increase in cases where technology has done irrefutable damage to its users. Despite intending to connect people and serve as a positive resource, tech companies such as Facebook, Uber, Twitter, AirBnB, and others have also become vehicles for hate, assaults, murder and more.

Though the stories we hear are extreme, fear not, for we have the power to make a difference. This power to make a change does not solely fall on CEOs and company founders. Even the entry level dev has the potential to make a positive change for countless users. It is imperative that we use our power for good.
