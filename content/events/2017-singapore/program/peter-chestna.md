Software development is changing and so are the roles that developers need to play. Over the last decade or so, companies have been trying to fill their ranks with what was called full-stack engineers. These developers were versed in software development from database to GUI and everything in between. This was necessary in the age of monolithic application architectures.

The move to DevOps and microservices demands new skills. Now a developer must become fluent in software testing, deployment, telemetry and even security. It is less about multi-layer and more about multi-discipline.

In this talk, Pete Chestna, Director of Developer Engagement will share his insights into this transformation, the opportunity that it presents to developers as lifelong learners as well as practical advice to get started. Don’t miss the shift. Get ahead of it!

What you will learn:
1. How software development leaders used to think about the developers they hire
2. How that is being transformed into a new breed of developer called the Full Spectrum Developer
3. How you can get their ahead of demand and be more valuable to both your current and future employers

### Why would this talk be a good fit for the DevOpsDays audience?

There is a fundamental shift in the requirements on developers. As team sizes shrink and responsibilities grow with the move to DevOps. Now a developer must become fluent in software testing, deployment, telemetry and even security. It is less about multi-layer and more about multi-discipline.
