I'm a Developer Advocate at Microsoft.  Previously, I was a Principal Engineer at Chef.

Before that, I was a Site Reliability Engineer at Stack Overflow. I'm active in the Chef, PowerShell, WinOps, and DevOps communities.

I'm a maintainer for several open source projects, including Chef and Test-Kitchen.
