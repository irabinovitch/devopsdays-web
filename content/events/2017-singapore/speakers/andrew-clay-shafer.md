Andrew Clay Shafer was devopsing before devops was a word.

He is often referenced as a foundational voice in the devops movement with a lot of experience and perspective contributing to open source, operating services and building communities.

As a co-founder of Puppet Labs, he had the privilege to watch the internal workings of many organizations who built the big web. Working on OpenStack and Cloud Foundry, he gained a greater appreciation for the challenges of enterprise IT.

Heâ€™s a life long learner who hopes he can help others learn too.
