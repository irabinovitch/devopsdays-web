I've previously run DevOps for a high-volume group coupon company (Piku) and Indiegogo.  More recently, I've been a major contributor to Cloud Foundry, including work on the Diego container scheduler and Windows containerization.  I now run Pivotal Labs in Singapore, and teach DevOps and agile software development to customers like DBS, SGX, and Singapore Airlines.
