## Keynote Speaker

Currently a Cloud Economist at The Quinn Advisory Group, Corey has a history as an engineering director, public speaker, and cloud architect. He specializes in helping companies address horrifying AWS bills, and curates <a href="http://www.lastweekinaws.com/" target="_blank">lastweekinaws.com</a>, a weekly newsletter summarizing the latest in AWS news, blogs, and tips, sprinkled with snark.

Outside of his professional work, Corey is known for overdressing, telling entertaining stories, and carrying a cigarette case full of tiny umbrellas.
