Iâ€™m a software engineer on the Operations Team at Slack. I love working on tough distributed systems problems, and learning from my team and the community! I have been a fond user and contributor to Open Source for over 10 years, with no plans on stopping anytime soon.

Previously, I was the Mesos/Aurora SRE Tech Lead at Twitter, and an Internal Technology Resident at Google. I received a Computer Science BS in May 2010 from Chapman University in Orange, California.
