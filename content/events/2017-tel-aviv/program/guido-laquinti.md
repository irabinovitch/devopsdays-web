The journey of a small operations team in a fast-growing environment is always challenging. This talk describes Slackâ€™s solutions to many of our technical and cultural challenges as we scale our technical operations team around the world. We will analyze key decisions, then dig into what went well and lessons learned along the way. Attendees can expect to hear details about many issues such as handoff between timezones, partnering with software engineers for significant projects, as well as dealing with long-running incidents.
