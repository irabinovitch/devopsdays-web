This lightning talk will introduce the goal to providing a better usage of Jenkins pipeline framework by: - Designing pipelines from development to production. - Identify the reusable bits. - Explore the main stages (build, deploy & test) and how each of them is a reusable pipeline phase. - Use shared libraries. - Aim toward a shift-left solution. - Provide a DevOps as a code solution.
