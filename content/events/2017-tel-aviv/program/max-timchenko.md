The transformation of the way we do infrastructure ownership at PagerDuty was a perfect opportunity for us to think deeply about the processes of hiring for and operating our SRE team. With a change to the team’s mission (helping, advising, and speeding up instead of holding the keys to all things infrastructure) came new skill requirements for working effectively on the team, updated interview sessions using some of the same technology we use to manage PagerDuty’s servers, and new ways to manage our day-to-day work.

Whether you are interested in getting your own SRE team started, or want to perform the same transition from classic Ops into DevOps, or just want to see how your already successful team’s processes compare with others, this talk should give you plenty of food for thought and examples of what happens to work quite well for us.
