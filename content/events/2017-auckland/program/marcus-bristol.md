Pushpay operates in the payments industry so we are very risk adverse, yet we are able to deploy to production up to a dozen times per day.

This talk will discuss the culture that enables this, and the tools and processes that have been built over time to support our fast pace. We will show how we can maintain a high quality codebase that has minimal technical debt, while simultaneously growing the team by over 800% in the last 2 years. Finally we will explain how our culture helps support us in those rare instances when something does go wrong.
