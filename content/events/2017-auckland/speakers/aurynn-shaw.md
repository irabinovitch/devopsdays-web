Aurynn is the founder of Eiara, a DevOps consultancy based out of Wellington, New Zealand, focussing on helping clients develop technical DevOps capability, and the cultural knowledge to use it.

With over a decade as a professional software developer, Aurynn’s expertise ranges from modern cloud deployments to massively parallel supercomputer environments.

As the defining voice of the ideas of “contempt culture”, Aurynn is working to change the very nature of how we create new technologies, and the questions that we must answer as we do.
